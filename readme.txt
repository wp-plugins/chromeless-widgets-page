== Description ==
Chromeless Widgets Page is a framework for building a specific-use page at a custom URL. Once you specify the URL slug, you can add widgets to the page and style it with CSS that's scoped to the page, all from within the Customizer.

This plugin is an open-sourced project originally built for the <a href="http://annenbergdl.org/">USC Annenberg Digital Lounge's events page, which is displayed on TV screens throughout our physical space. It isn't actively developed or supported, but feel free to fork the plugin if you'd like to make adjustments to make it fit your related or unrelated needs.
